The game allows you to guess a number
You have 3 trials
after 3rd try with a fail, you are shown the answer and choose whether you want to continue

NOTE
I coded this game with the help of the experience I got from learning C since I didnt know what object and class and all that stuff at that time.Hence I might have misused some Java principles and crap...ik ik.
I will correct that with time. Thats why I'm in github right?...Ill just pull request
